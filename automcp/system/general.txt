AutoLens is a library that facilitates modelling, simulation, and analysis of strong gravitational lensing systems.

The AutoLens server provides tools for interaction with the AutoLens library, allowing users to perform tasks such as:
- **Modeling**: Create and manipulate lens models to fit observational data.
- **Simulation**: Generate synthetic lensing data based on specified models.
- **Analysis**: Analyze lensing data to extract physical parameters and properties of the lensing system.
- **Visualization**: Visualize lensing models and data to aid in interpretation and understanding.

A dataset is referenced by a path to a directory on the filesystem. This variable is always called `dataset_path`.

A Component might represent an instance of a galaxy, a light profile, a mass profile, or any other element in the lensing system.

A Component can be described by a dictionary with the following keys:
- 'type': The type of the component
- 'arguments': A dictionary of arguments for the component

The `type` will usually be 'instance' or 'model'. 'instance' refers to a specific realization of a component, while 'model'
refers to a representation of a component with free parameters that may be optimized over.

If the `type` is 'instance' then `class_path` must be given to indicate the class of the component, and `arguments` must be a dictionary of arguments for that instance.

The component resource provides a menu of components that can be used in the AutoLens library.

Each component has four fields:

model - this is an example of how that component can be represented as a model.
instance - this is an example of how that component can be represented as an instance.
doc - describes the component and its usage.
name - the name of the component.

A galaxy is a component that represents a galaxy in the lensing system.

It has a redshift argument and can contain light profiles and mass profiles.
These profiles are given as arguments and can have any name in the dictionary.

Here is an example of a galaxy component with a bulge and a disk light profile:
